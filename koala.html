                    <p>Kaolas are marsupials native to Australia, known for their distinctive appearance and diet consisting of mainly eucalyptus leaves.
                        They are arboreal, spenidng most of their time in trees.</p>

                        <p>Koalas are generally quiet animals but can make loud calls during the mating season.
                            they are considered vulnerable because of the habitat loss and other environmental factors.
