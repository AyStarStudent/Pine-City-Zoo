                    <h3>ELEPHANTS</h3>
                    <p>Elephants are large mammals of the family Elephanditae and the orderProbscidea. Two are tradiionally recognised,
                        the African elephant (Loxondota africana) and the asian elephant (Elelphas maximus),
                        although some evience suggets that African bush elephants and African forest elephants are seperate species 
                        (l. africana and L. cyclotis respecively). Elephants are scattered throughout Sub-Suharan Africa, South Asia,
                         and South East Asia. Elephantidae is the only surviving fammily of the order Proboscidae; other, now exinct, 
                         members of the order include deinotheres, gomphotheres, mammoths, and mastodons. Male African elephants are 
                         largest extant terrestrial animals and can reach a height of 4 m (13 ft) and weigh 7,000 kg (15 000lb).</p>
                         <p>All elephants have several disincting features, the most notable of which is he trunk or proboscis, used  for many purposes, 
                            paricularly breathing, lifting water and grasping objects. Their incisors grow into tusks
                            which can serve as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. Elephants' large ear flaps help to 
                            control theirbody temperature. Their pillar lke legs carry heir reat weight. African elephants have larger ears 
                            and concave backs while Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs.</p> 
                            <p>Elephants are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats including savannahs, forests, deserts and marshes
                                They prefer to stay near water.</p>
                                        <strong><p>WHERE TO FIND THEM</p></strong>
                                 <P>You will find the elephants a pen E22, right next to amphitheatre.</P>
