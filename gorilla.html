                    <h3>GORILLA</h3>
                    <p>Gorillas are ground-dwelling, the largest primates within African lands.
                        predominantly herbivorous apes . They can be dvided into two main species: 
                        the eastern gorilla and the western gorilla. They feed on various plants including 
                        leaves, shoots and fruits.</p> 
                        <h3>THE GANG MEMBER!</h3>
                        
                        <p>Gorillas are highly social animals, leaving in grouos led by a dominant male.
                            Here at the Zoo the Gorillas are kept in their large enclosed grounds where they can move
                            freely like in their natural habitat, allowing them to engage in natural behaviours.</p>
